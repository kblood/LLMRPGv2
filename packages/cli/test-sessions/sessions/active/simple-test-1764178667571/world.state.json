Its walls are riddled with gaping holes and crumbling towers, as if time itself has been trying to reclaim it. The surrounding forests twist and contort into unnatural shapes, their gnarled branches reaching out like skeletal fingers. The lake at the base reflects the sky but hides a darker reality beneath its surface. A chilling wind whispers secrets of forgotten lore, carrying with it an eerie resonance that seems to emanate from the very heart of the keep.",
