The air is thick with an eerie silence save for the distant echo of wind through broken branches. Here, where four roads diverge into oblivion, you find yourself standing at the center of this forgotten land. Suddenly, a shadowy figure emerges from the mist, cloaked and hooded, pausing before your group. The stranger speaks in hushed tones, 'You seek power that lies buried beneath these ruins? You wish to uncover Eldoria's secrets?'",
