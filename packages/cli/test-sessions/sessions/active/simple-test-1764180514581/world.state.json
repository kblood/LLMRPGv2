Its surface is etched with runes that pulse faintly in the dim light, casting eerie reflections across the cracked pavement below. A thick fog has settled over the city, muffling the distant cries of creatures that should not be here, and a chill wind stirs through the crumbling buildings, carrying whispers of ancient secrets long buried beneath the ruins.\n\nThe once-bustling market square is now empty, save for scattered debris and forgotten stalls. A lone figure huddles by the edge of the archway, their back turned to you, clutching an ornate dagger that glows with a soft blue light. The figure's eyes are closed, as if lost in a deep reverie or perhaps a nightmare.\n\nAs you approach, you notice footprints leading away from the archway into the depths of the city, but they end abruptly before reaching any known passage or path. The air seems to hum with an unseen energy, and you can feel the weight of power emanating from the dagger in your possession.",
