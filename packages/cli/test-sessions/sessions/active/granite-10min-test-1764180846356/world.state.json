The fortress is in ruins, its towers leaning like the bones of a dying civilization. Overgrown vines cling to ancient stones, and the air feels heavy with an unnatural chill.\n\nA faint glow emanates from one of the broken archways, drawing you closer. Inside, you find an old journal half-buried beneath piles of dust, its pages filled with cryptic notes about a dark ritual that once took place here—a ceremony meant to bind the realms together but instead tore them asunder.\n\nSuddenly, a chilling wind sweeps through the keep, and the shadows seem to move on their own. An eerie melody echoes from somewhere within the depths of the fortress, a haunting tune that fills you with both dread and an inexplicable yearning to uncover its source.",
