The air is thick with the scent of decay and the whispers of long-buried secrets. Crumbling stone archways loom overhead, their edges worn smooth by time and the elements. Twisted trees, their bark etched with malevolent faces, seem to watch you with unblinking eyes. Suddenly, a faint glow emanates from one of the arches, drawing your attention towards an ancient portal that pulses with dark energy.",
