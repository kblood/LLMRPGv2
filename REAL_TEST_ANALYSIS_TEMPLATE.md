## Session Observations (So Far)

### 🌍 World Generation
- **Theme:** "The Shattered Realms" (High Fantasy)
- **Starting Location:** The Shattered Realms (tavern/bazaar area)
- **World Hook:** Artifact emergence plot with dangerous collectors faction

### 🎮 Gameplay Progress (Turn 35+ and continuing)

#### Location Exploration

3. **The Forgotten Sanctum** - Deep exploration location (Turns 12-13)
4. **Echoing Caverns** - Further progression (Turns 14-15)
5. **The Shattered Sanctum** - Cathedral location (Turns 16-35+)

#### Turn Outcomes Distribution

- **Successes:** Multiple successful location travels (Turns 8, 12, 13, 15)
- **Failures:** NPC/Shop interactions when not present
- **Ties:** Navigation uncertainty

#### Story Elements Observed
✅ **Dynamic Location Generation** - New locations created as player explores
✅ **Aspect Integration** - "Haunted Past" repeatedly relevant to narrative
✅ **Narration Quality** - Detailed, atmospheric descriptions
✅ **Challenge Variety** - Mix of exploration, social, and navigation
⚠️ **NPC Sparsity** - Few NPCs encountered (world generation issue?)
⚠️ **Repetition Pattern** - Some actions repeat (investigation attempts)

## Story Quality Assessment

### What's Working Well ✅
1. **World Coherence** - Locations connect logically and build a narrative
2. **LLM Narration** - Rich, atmospheric descriptions from Granite4:3b
3. **Aspect Utilization** - GM using player aspects for compelling narrative tension
4. **Location System** - Dynamic generation creating new areas to explore
5. **Progression** - Clear movement from starting area toward deeper locations

### Areas Needing Attention ⚠️

2. **NPC Encounters** - Few meaningful NPC interactions
3. **Outcome Variety** - High compel rate might indicate constrained challenges
4. **Social Interaction** - Limited dialogue-based gameplay
5. **World Population** - Locations feel empty (faction generation issue?)

## Post-Test Analysis Plan

Once test completes (estimated time: 5-10 more minutes):

1. ✅ **Run Continuation Test** - Add 10 more turns to existing session
2. ✅ **Generate Statistics** - Session-level metrics and quality scores
3. ✅ **Export to Markdown** - Full session narrative export
4. ✅ **Story Quality Review** - Analyze narrative coherence and pacing
5. ✅ **Performance Report** - LLM inference times and resource usage

## Expected Findings

Based on early output:

- **Estimated Total Turns:** 100-150 (based on 3.7s average per turn × 600s)
- **Predicted Locations:** 20-30 (based on ~1 new location per 5 turns)
- **Expected Success Rate:** 30-40% (mix of compels, ties, failures)
- **Story Quality:** Likely B+ or A (good narration, some repetition issues)

---

## Continuation Strategy

After initial 10-minute test completes:
- Load saved session
- Run 5-10 continuation turns with same AI player
- Verify state persistence and session continuity
- Check if AI learns from previous patterns
