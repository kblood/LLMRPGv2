# Project Status

**Last Updated:** November 25, 2025

## 📍 Current Phase: Phase 7 - Refinement & Polish (In Progress)

We are refining the system, improving prompts, and adding robustness.

## ✅ Recent Accomplishments

### 1. Project Scaffolding (Phase 1)
- Initialized Git repository.
- Created **pnpm monorepo** structure.
- Configured **TypeScript**, **ESLint**, **Prettier**, and **Vitest**.

### 2. Core Implementation (Phase 2)
- **Fate Mechanics**: `FateDice`, `ActionResolver`, `TheLadder`.
- **Turn System**: `TurnManager`, `GameEvent`.
- **State System**: `DeltaCollector`, `CharacterDefinition`.
- **Testing**: 17/17 Unit Tests passing.

### 3. Storage Implementation (Phase 3)
- **FileSystemAdapter**: Implemented `fs-extra` based adapter.
- **SessionWriter**: Implemented session creation and logging.
- **SessionLoader**: Implemented session loading.
- **Testing**: Verified storage operations.

### 4. LLM Layer (Phase 4)
- **LLMProvider Interface**: Defined common interface for AI models.
- **OpenAIAdapter**: Implemented adapter for OpenAI API.
- **OpenRouterAdapter**: Implemented adapter for OpenRouter API.
- **OllamaAdapter**: Implemented adapter for local Ollama models.
- **ContextBuilder**: Implemented logic to construct prompts from game state.
- **Testing**: Verified adapters and context builder.

### 5. Protocol & Debug (Phase 5)
- **Protocol Package**: Implemented shared types and Zod schemas in `packages/protocol`.
- **Debug Package**: Implemented `StateInspector`, `ReplayDebugger`, and `ContextDebugger` in `packages/debug`.
- **Integration**: Verified system integration with `examples/demo.ts`.

### 6. Game Loop & CLI (Phase 6)
- **CLI Package**: Created `packages/cli` with dependencies.
- **GameMaster**: Implemented `GameMaster` class to orchestrate the game.
- **GameLoop**: Implemented `GameLoop` class for the main input loop.
- **Systems**: Implemented `NarrativeEngine`, `ContentGenerator`, `DecisionEngine` with real LLM integration.
- **Testing**: Verified end-to-end flow with `MockAdapter`. `full_playthrough.test.ts` verifies turn generation, event logging, and file storage.
- **Entry Point**: Implemented `index.ts` with `commander` and `inquirer`.

### 7. Refinement & Polish (Phase 7)
- **World Manager**: Implemented `WorldManager` in `packages/cli` with full `WorldState` support from `@llmrpg/protocol`.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Refined `ContextBuilder` to include detailed character info (personality, backstory). Updated system prompts in `NarrativeEngine`, `DecisionEngine`, and `ContentGenerator` to align with `docs/LLM_CONTEXT_AND_PROMPTS.md`.
- **Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks and fallbacks to LLM-based engines to handle generation failures gracefully.

## 🚧 Current Context
- `packages/cli` is built and compiles.
- `WorldManager` is now fully implemented.
- Prompts are more robust and aligned with documentation.
- Error handling is in place for LLM calls.

## 📋 Next Steps (Immediate)

### Phase 8: Advanced Features & Content
1.  **World Generation**: Implement logic to generate a starting world/scenario using `ContentGenerator` and `WorldManager`.
2.  **Character Creation**: Implement a CLI flow to create a character (interactive character generation).
3.  **Save/Load**: Ensure `GameMaster` can load an existing session and restore state.
4.  **Documentation**: Continue updating documentation.

## 🐛 Known Issues / Notes
- None currently.
