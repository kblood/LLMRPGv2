# Project Status

**Last Updated:** November 26, 2025

## 📍 Current Phase: Phase 7 - Refinement & Polish (In Progress)

We are refining the system, improving prompts, and adding robustness.

## ✅ Recent Accomplishments

### 1. Project Scaffolding (Phase 1)
- Initialized Git repository.
- Created **pnpm monorepo** structure.
- Configured **TypeScript**, **ESLint**, **Prettier**, and **Vitest**.

### 2. Core Implementation (Phase 2)
- **Fate Mechanics**: `FateDice`, `ActionResolver`, `TheLadder`.
- **Turn System**: `TurnManager`, `GameEvent`.
- **State System**: `DeltaCollector`, `CharacterDefinition`.
- **Testing**: 17/17 Unit Tests passing.

### 3. Storage Implementation (Phase 3)
- **FileSystemAdapter**: Implemented `fs-extra` based adapter.
- **SessionWriter**: Implemented session creation and logging.
- **SessionLoader**: Implemented session loading.
- **Testing**: Verified storage operations.

### 4. LLM Layer (Phase 4)
- **LLMProvider Interface**: Defined common interface for AI models.
- **OpenAIAdapter**: Implemented adapter for OpenAI API.
- **OpenRouterAdapter**: Implemented adapter for OpenRouter API.
- **OllamaAdapter**: Implemented adapter for local Ollama models.
- **ContextBuilder**: Implemented logic to construct prompts from game state.
- **Testing**: Verified adapters and context builder.

### 5. Protocol & Debug (Phase 5)
- **Protocol Package**: Implemented shared types and Zod schemas in `packages/protocol`.
- **Debug Package**: Implemented `StateInspector`, `ReplayDebugger`, and `ContextDebugger` in `packages/debug`.
- **Integration**: Verified system integration with `examples/demo.ts`.

### 6. Game Loop & CLI (Phase 6)
- **CLI Package**: Created `packages/cli` with dependencies.
- **GameMaster**: Implemented `GameMaster` class to orchestrate the game.
- **GameLoop**: Implemented `GameLoop` class for the main input loop.
- **Systems**: Implemented `NarrativeEngine`, `ContentGenerator`, `DecisionEngine` with real LLM integration.
- **Testing**: Verified end-to-end flow with `MockAdapter`. `full_playthrough.test.ts` verifies turn generation, event logging, and file storage.
- **Entry Point**: Implemented `index.ts` with `commander` and `inquirer`.

### 7. Refinement & Polish (Phase 7)
- **World Manager**: Implemented `WorldManager` in `packages/cli` with full `WorldState` support from `@llmrpg/protocol`.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Refined `ContextBuilder` to include detailed character info (personality, backstory). Updated system prompts in `NarrativeEngine`, `DecisionEngine`, and `ContentGenerator` to align with `docs/LLM_CONTEXT_AND_PROMPTS.md`.
- **Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks and fallbacks to LLM-based engines to handle generation failures gracefully.
- **CLI Automation**: Added `--theme` and `--run` flags to the CLI to support automated testing and non-interactive execution.
- **Context Integration**: Updated `GameMaster`, `DecisionEngine`, and `NarrativeEngine` to fully utilize the 5-layer context system (System, Character, World, History, Immediate). Implemented `getCharacterDefinition` mapper and history tracking in `GameMaster`.
- **Action Classification**: Implemented `classifyAction` in `DecisionEngine` to dynamically map player intent to Fate Core actions (Overcome, Create Advantage, Attack, Defend) using the LLM.
- **Skill Selection**: Implemented `selectSkill` in `DecisionEngine` to intelligently pick the most relevant character skill for an action.
- **Action Resolution**: Integrated `ActionResolver` into `GameMaster` to handle dice rolls, skill ratings, and opposition, determining outcomes (Success, Failure, Tie, Style).
- **Consequence Handling**: Added `applyActionConsequences` to `GameMaster` to handle specific mechanical results of actions (e.g., logging damage for Attacks, noting advantages).

### 8. Advanced Features & Content (Phase 8)
- **World Generation**: Implemented `generateStartingScenario` in `ContentGenerator` and integrated it into `GameMaster`. The system now generates a theme, starting location, and an initial scenario with a hook.
- **Character Creation**: Implemented `generateCharacter` in `ContentGenerator` and `createCharacter` in `GameMaster`. The CLI now prompts for a character concept and generates a full `PlayerCharacter` with aspects, skills, stunts, and personality.
- **Save/Load**: Implemented `saveState` and `loadState` in `GameMaster`. Added `--load` flag to CLI to resume sessions. Fixed directory structure for session storage.
- **Testing**: Added `tests/save_load.test.ts` to verify the save/load cycle and delta generation.
- **Ollama Integration Testing**: Added `tests/ollama_playthrough.test.ts` to verify full system functionality with local LLMs (specifically tested with Granite4:3b). Added `test:ollama` script to `packages/cli`.
- **Action Validation Testing**: Added `tests/action_validation.test.ts` to verify specific LLM decisions (difficulty setting) and GM event generation. Added `test:actions` script.
- **Knowledge System**: Implemented comprehensive knowledge tracking (`KnowledgeProfile`, `KnowledgeManager`) in `packages/protocol` and `packages/core`. Integrated with `GameMaster` and `DecisionEngine` to allow players to discover locations, NPCs, and secrets via gameplay actions. Added `knowledge_gain` event type. Verified with `tests/knowledge_system.test.ts`.

## 🚧 Current Context
- `packages/cli` is built and compiles.
- World Generation, Character Creation, Save/Load, and Knowledge System are implemented and verified.
- `WorldManager` is now fully implemented.
- **Combat System**: Fully implemented and tested. The system now supports structured combat encounters with initiative, turns, and NPC AI.
- **Storage**: Updated to persist NPC states alongside player and world state.
- **Mocking**: Enhanced `MockAdapter` to support response queuing for deterministic testing of complex flows.
- Prompts are more robust and aligned with documentation.
- Error handling is in place for LLM calls.
- CLI supports automated execution for testing.

## 📋 Next Steps (Immediate)

### Phase 8: Advanced Features & Content
1.  **Quest/Goal System**: Implement objective tracking.
2.  **Social Conflict**: Adapt the combat engine for social encounters.
3.  **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect the new Combat System architecture.
